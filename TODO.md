<small>I'm always looking to add more themes! Feel free to make a merge request and i'll take a look at your theme.<br />
(If you don't know how to do a Merge request, Just start an issue & have a link to the github repo of your Theme)</small>

##### Sidenote: All of these will be implemented in Bootstrap, To allow a user to switch themes easily & only have to change the CSS file.
